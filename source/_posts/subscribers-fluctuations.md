Over the past few days, the subscriber count on my channel has been fluctuating wildly and inorganically, instantly jumping up and down by up to a hundred. Just look at the plot. Numeric data by minute can be found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/6503edbb2dd22be83376fe2fbfce89fa/raw/09c07732e0c6fd8446d2e69759c4cea00b19e565/subscribers.dat). What the heck, YouTube?

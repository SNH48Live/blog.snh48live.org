This is the mandatory hello world post.

So, why am I starting a blog for [snh48live.org](https://snh48live.org)? The channel has been up for 113 days since its inception on March 22, 2017, and it now boasts 970 subscribers and 100k+ views. Quite an achievement, and I'm really excited about it. I figured I need a place to record some of the milestones, interesting finds (I've never run a YouTube channel seriously prior to this, so I learn new things every once in a while), thoughts and stuff; and since short-form writing has never been my greatest strength, Twitter is not the right platform for this. Hence a blog. Mostly for myself.

I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to write about, other than for the first two or three posts, this one included. The blog may even become dormant after the first week; I just don't know. Another thing I'm not sure about is the language of this blog. I'll probably use whatever language I'm most comfortable with on a given topic, which means English for technical stuff, Chinese when I need to speak a lot of proper nouns (girls, performances, etc.), and so on.

I'm choosing [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) as the generator for this blog, and am using the [Even](http://www.ahonn.me/hexo-theme-even/) theme as a basis. Hopefully I'll like Hexo better than Jekyll, which isn't a high bar to clear.
